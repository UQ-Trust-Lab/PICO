Enable the skill here then install the ""Phone Link for Alexa"" app from Google Play. Direct Link: phonelinkskill.com/download

ADVANCED PHONE AND TABLET LOCATOR: 

If your device is close by, you can make it ring - even if it's in silent mode or has the do not disturb setting turned on. If the device is further away, you can get its approximate address. Just say something like ""Ask Phone Link to ring my phone"" or ""Ask Phone Link to find my tablet"".

PHONE CALLS: 

You can ask Alexa to start a phone call on your phone. It will even turn on your phone's speakerphone if you don't have a Bluetooth connection. Just say something like ""Ask phone link to call John Smith"".

TEXT MESSAGING: 

Phone link can read out and send text messages from many popular apps, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, your phone's SMS app, and many others.

Just say something like ""Ask Phone Link to send a text to Jane Doe."" or ""Ask Phone Link to read my messages.""

If supported by your Alexa device, you can optionally have Alexa notify you when you have unread messages. When you see the notification light, just say ""Alexa, what did I miss?""

MUSIC AND AUDIO STREAMING:

Stream music and audio files stored on your Android device to your Alexa device or app, giving Alexa access to your entire mp3 collection. You can direct Alexa to play by playlist, title, album, artist, or genre. The Phone Link app can be used to set up your playlists.

To start playback, just say something like ""Ask Phone Link to play my workout playlist"" or ""Ask Phone Link to play some rock music"".

WORKS WITH ECHO AUTO AND IN-CAR SYSTEMS:

Enable the skill here then install the ""Phone Link for Alexa"" app from Google Play. Direct Link: phonelinkskill.com/download

ADVANCED PHONE AND TABLET LOCATOR: 

If your device is close by, you can make it ring - even if it's in silent mode or has the do not disturb setting turned on. If the device is further away, you can get its approximate address. Just say something like ""Ask Phone Link to ring my phone"" or ""Ask Phone Link to find my tablet"".

PHONE CALLS: 

You can ask Alexa to start a phone call on your phone. It will even turn on your phone's speakerphone if you don't have a Bluetooth connection. Just say something like ""Ask phone link to call John Smith"".

TEXT MESSAGING: 

Phone link can read out and send text messages from many popular apps, including Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, your phone's SMS app, and many others. It is also able to read and reply to messages received in Gmail. It works by monitoring your notifications for incoming messages. This is the same system used by Wear OS and Android Auto. Just say something like ""Ask Phone Link to send a text to Jane Doe."" or ""Ask Phone Link to read my messages.""

If supported by your Alexa device, you can optionally have Alexa notify you when you have unread messages. When you see the notification light, just say ""Alexa, what did I miss?""

MUSIC AND AUDIO STREAMING:

Stream music and audio files stored on your Android device to your Alexa device or app, giving Alexa access to your entire mp3 collection. You can direct Alexa to play by playlist, title, album, artist, or genre. The Phone Link app can be used to set up your playlists.

To start playback, just say something like ""Ask Phone Link to play my workout playlist"" or ""Ask Phone Link to play some rock music"".

WORKS WITH ECHO AUTO AND IN-CAR SYSTEMS:

Phone Link works with the Echo Auto and in-car systems, providing a safe way to send and receive text messages hands-free.

SUPPORTS FAMILIES AND PARENTAL MONITORING:

You can use phone link with multiple devices in your household. Just include the device's name in your voice command (e.g, ""Ask Phone Link to find John's Phone"").  Parents can use it to monitor the location of their children as well as the text messages they are receiving.

For example, we ban anything that contains corn syrup. We rather want to grow slow with natural products than growing fast with unhealthy foods that are against our principle values. Our another focus is delivery. To offer safer, and faster delivery, we currently operate two fulfillment centers - Brooklyn, New York and Los Angeles, California. On average, customers receive their orders in 2 business days anywhere in the U.S.We began our journey with very personal reasons. Ryan Kim, the founder, lost his young uncle in summer 2018. The young uncle who was only 45 left two young sons. Ryan was the only male adult in the immigrant family and learned anyone in the family can't afford to be unhealthy. He became conscious about food intakes, and frustrated to learn that it's very difficult to get clean, healthy Korean food and ingredients. He asked around his friends in New York, and they only shared their own frustrations. So in 2019, Ryan launched the site with only five products. He shipped all over the U.S. He hand delivered Manhattan and Brooklyn orders in the same day to give the best Korean food products fastest. Still small, Kim'C Market is offering almost 180 SKUs as of January 2021. Most of the customers find us by word of mouth.

For example, you can say:""Alexa, tell veterans health I'd like to visit a doctor near 100 Legends Way, Boston, MA"" ""Alexa, tell veterans health I need care near Boston, MA"" ""Alexa, tell veterans health I need care near 4 Yawkey Way, Boston, MA""And Alexa will tell you exactly where to go to get care, quickly. You can use your full address for the most accurate driving time information and locations, or even just your city and state. This skill utilizes the Veterans Administrations public API, available here: https://developer.va.gov/  This product is not affiliated with, endorsed by, or supported by the Department of Veterans Affairs.More about Same-Day care by the VA: https://www.va.gov/opa/pressrel/pressrelease.cfm?id3998",21

With our intelligent AI, we use reinforcement learning to respond to your air conditioner settings. All you need to do is set the temperature you're comfortable with, and we'll handle the rest when you ask Hive to run in Eco Mode. Hive also tracks your energy usage information so you can not only know whether you're saving energy, but also understand it, and compare it consumers in your area.Air conditioners use a lot of energy. In fact, in Thailand for example, A/Cs account for over *60%* of the average monthly electricity bill for homes. That's a lot of cash.Core Features:- Eco Mode: Gives Hive control of your air conditioner temperature to more efficiently manage its energy usage. As you run Eco Mode, Hive will track the amount of energy you saved compared to not using Eco Mode. Eco Mode learns from the temperature control commands you give Hive, so if it's not working for you Hive will learn and adjust.- Temperature Control: Hive lets you control your A/C normally by giving you direct access to its temperature settings. However, when you set the temperature from Hive, our AI learns from your commands and adjusts Eco Mode to your comfort setting accordingly.- Energy Usage Tracking: As you save energy, Hive keeps track of it. We enable users to compare their energy usage to others in their nearby area so they can see effective they really are at saving energy. You can also ask Hive what your current energy usage is by simply asking ""How am I doing?"" or ""What's my current energy usage?"".- Tier Status: The amount of energy you save is not only tracked, but also rated in a competitive, tiered ranking system. There are 4 tiers: Bronze, Silver, Gold, Platinum. The overall top energy savers are placed in Platinum.- Energy Saving Tips: We don't expect everyone to be an energy saving expert, which is why we reinforce this experience with practical, feasible energy saving tips. Simple ask Hive for an energy saving tip to get one.--- Setup ---Right now users can fully interact with our lab environment which is fully equipped with the hardware to monitor, track, and change energy usage with an air conditioner (use all core functionalities of the skill) with zero setup.

To address that from a pure and good motive by developing AI to enhance human wellness, Ikigai Journey addresses this trust issue and taps into human psychology to build a social relationship. The Ikigai Journey Skill enhances Alexa__ social ability to build trust. When we use Ikigai Journey, we have a strong sense that __lexa_ is interested in US being the best human beings that we can be.Ikigai Journey v1 enters a cycle of exploration and inquiry, inviting users to share information about themselves and their beliefs. This helps our data scientists understand patterns and behaviors to best direct our subscribers to actionable solutions. New clarity on what is working and what is missing that, once developed, will support new thoughts, actions, and choices to elevate their experience of themselves and being alive, giving a new sense of purpose and well-being.Ikigai Journey was built upon a body of research proposing 7 Dimensions of Wellness: social, emotional, spiritual, environmental, occupational, intellectual, and physical. When we spend time dedicated to each of these, the quality and experience of life improve dramatically.Ikigai is a Japanese concept meaning ""reason for being."" The word usually indicates the source of value in life or the things that make life worthwhile. Translated to English it means ""thing that you live for"" or ""reason for which you wake in the morning.""Our Skill is prescriptive to support our ""Journeyers"" toward an increased level of peace, power, satisfaction, and fulfillment. Using Alexa and Amazon-based skills, platforms, and tools, Ikigai Journey delivers the right motivational content, right when our Journeyers need it most in their lives. Ikigai Journey is a friend, confidant, mirror, open listener, coach, and counselor that helps our Journeyers get the answers they already have but just haven__ yet seen consciously for themselves. And Ikigai Journey has specific suggestions for users, from video content, movies, music, reading materials, coaching, and subscriptions to wellness products and conscious commerce solutions.Our Alexa Skill begins with a 12-Day Course utilizing Alexa and AWS Tools to quickly create a profile using queries, surveys, and social graphs. Each Ikigai Journey is personal and specific to an individual's life, values, and beliefs, reflecting the inner self and expressing that faithfully, while simultaneously creating a mental state of ease. Responses are parsed and voice-to-text tech used to record answers in the database. This data supports us in building an Ikigai user graph. Their first interaction requires us to provide some immediate and recognizable value to support them returning for subsequent Ikigai sessions. Activities are never forced; they are often spontaneous, and always undertaken willingly, giving satisfaction and a sense of meaning and direction. The scripted Journey of reflection is deeply detailed, to provide multiple ways into understanding: What You Love, What You Are Good At, What You Can be Paid For, and What the World Needs.Understanding basic demographics and more complex aspects of online behaviors that could be available on the internet, this is not meant to be an intrusion on privacy, but designed to allow us to discover what the story of this user could be, and how quickly we can provide valuable insight and support. What do we know about the Amazon user already? Can we quickly build their profile based on Public Data or aggregating social media profiles to create their Ikigai identity? And, can we do this in a way that is gentle to the user but powerful for us to help our Alexa Skill get a sense about this User and have AI/ML structures designed to quickly get them inspired?

It focuses on public awareness of skin cancer, including an annual __uromelanoma Screening Day_; sharing knowledge and best practice with the healthcare community; and working with policymakers to ensure the treatment of skin cancer is fully recognised and supported in healthcare systems and policies. Euromelanoma is a registered charity and is active in 33 countries. For more information or with questions about Euromelanoma visit: www.euromelanoma.orgThe Global Coalition for Melanoma Patient Advocacy was formed in 2014 by the Melanoma Research Foundation in response to the global need to bring the patient voice to the melanoma space.

The Coalition meets the vital needs of the worldwide melanoma community through three working groups, which each specialize in a unique area that addresses globally relevant issues for melanoma patients, encompassing melanoma awareness, access to treatment, and clinical trial design and access.

With your My Jokes list all set up, it's time to get funny... To add, remove, or edit a joke, simply open your Alexa app, choose Lists from the app menu, and then select the My Jokes list.  We've entered a few jokes here to kick things off -- feel free to change or even delete them.  Most of all, we're hoping you'll add a lot of your own jokes.

Now, to hear one of your jokes, just say, ""Alexa, tell MY jokes""

Be as silly or as clever as you like.  Be pun-ny.  Write a riddle.  Or, maybe have Alexa recite a nonsensical poem.  It's all up to you!


Here are a few fun tips and tricks:
* Emphasize Words - Try putting asterisks around a word to emphasize it.  For example, try this as a punchline: French *flies*
* Create-Your-Own-Jokes cloud - Want to tap into Create Your Own Jokes' world-wide list of jokes?  Just enter the word  Joke  in your My Jokes list.  When Alexa sees the word  Joke  all by itself, she knows to grab a random joke from the Create-My-Own-Jokes cloud.  In fact, you could whittle your My Jokes list down to just this one ""joke"" and it would still provide plenty of humor.
* Share your Comedic Genius - The jokes you enter are eligible to become part of the Create-Your-Own-Jokes cloud.  Every so often, the intelligent staff at Create Your Own Jokes review all the jokes entered by the skill's users and, if deemed good and *suitable for the general public* (all decisions are final!), they are granted entrance into the world-wide list of jokes.

With Alexa, many of those questions could be asked in your home prior to the visit, and a short, relevant symptom statement could be generated that could then be shared with your clinician via a custom Symptom Helper List on your Alexa App during your office visit.

Should you choose to enter just the first 6 questions, you will be able to complete the rest when you are ready.  With either choice you will get a concise symptom summary.  Why so many questions?

Disney World is in 192 days.""You: ""Alexa, ask Days Until to set up daily reminders for Disney World.""Alexa: ""Okay, what time of day would you like to be reminded?""You: ""3 PM.""Alexa: ""You're all set. I'll send you daily reminders during the 10 days before Disney World.""CREATING A NEW COUNTDOWNSet up a countdown with any of these phrases:- ""Alexa, open Days Until.""- ""Alexa, ask Days Until to start a new countdown.""- ""Alexa, ask Days Until to create a countdown for the first day of school.""- ""Alexa, ask Days Until to create a new countdown for the first day of school on August 21st.""- ""Alexa, tell Days Until to begin a new one on the 21st of August for the first day of school.""Alexa will then confirm the event name and date before the countdown is saved.CHECKING A COUNTDOWNAfter you've created a countdown, you can ask Alexa how many days there are until the event:- ""Alexa, ask Days Until, 'How many days until the first day of school?'""- ""Alexa, ask Days Until, 'How long until the first day of school?'""- ""Alexa, open Days Until and tell me how much time there is until the first day of school.""Alexa will then calculate the number of days from today until the event's date and report back to you. If you have a video-enabled Alexa device, Alexa will also show the result on the screen.CHECKING ALL COUNTDOWNSYou can get a complete list of all your countdowns by asking:- ""Alexa, ask Days Until to list all my countdowns.""Video-enabled devices will show all countdowns on the screen.SETTING UP DAILY COUNTDOWN REMINDERSAfter creating a countdown, Alexa will prompt you to create daily reminders during the 10 days leading up to the event.You can also set up these reminders manually by saying:- ""Alexa, ask Days Until to create daily reminders.""- ""Alexa, ask Days Until to set up reminders for my birthday.""CORRECTING A COUNTDOWNIf you create a countdown with the wrong date, simply recreate the event with the same name. The old countdown will be automatically replaced with the new countdown.DELETING A COUNTDOWNIf you no longer want a countdown, just ask Alexa to delete it:- ""Alexa, ask Days Until to delete a countdown.""- ""Alexa, ask Days Until to erase my birthday.""Deleting a countdown will also delete any reminders for the event that were created by Days Until.TIPS AND TRICKSIf you're having trouble getting Alexa to recognize your event name, try something a bit simpler. For example, instead of ""John Smith's retirement party at the lakehouse"", try ""the retirement party"", or even just ""the party"".In some cases, you may be able to leave out the skill name and just say:- ""Alexa, how long until the first day of school?""Days Until also works great on video-enabled Alexa devices.

Of course, if several can move there, then I'll pick one randomly (I can't read your mind!).3) ""Move pawn to bishop"" to attack your opponent! Sometimes it's nice to do a little damage...4) ""F 6 to E 3"" to move. You can drop the word ""move"" if you prefer.5) ""Castle"", ""En Passant"", and ""Promote"" are all commands where I will seek out the matching move on the board and make it. WHAT IF I SCREW UP?We all screw up sometimes. I know I do. A lot. Like 'a lot' a lot.Sometimes you might even just want to cheat...1) Say ""Undo my last move"" to go back one move. Just ""undo"" works too. Hey, just so you know...this won't work in competitive games.2) Say ""Start a new game"" to give up and begin anew. Quitters don't prosper, but if you concede we'll never know if you might have had a stellar late game comeback!3) Before making a new game, change your game type.- ""Change game type to local"" sets you up for local games.- ""Search for a competitive game"" will find another player to match you against! If/when a game is found it will end your current game and thrust the new one upon you!- ""Change game type to computer"" for default games.Remember that after you change your game type you'll need to start a new game.WHAT IF I NEED A LITTLE BIT OF HELP?No shame in that. I built this silly skill and honestly I lose far more often than I win...1) Say ""What are my valid moves"" to hear a list of options. It shuffles each time, so you can try again to hear more! ""Legal Moves"" also works.2) ""What moves can my pawns make?"" if you want to be more specific! Ask about any piece type!3) Say ""Where are my bishops?"" to find your pieces on the board. ""Where are my opponent's rooks"" also works!4) Say ""Increase the difficulty"" to make the computer work harder! ""Decrease the difficulty"" will make things easier. This setting only goes into effect on your next game (no getting to right before a check mate and bumping your difficulty to make it look like you're better than you are...)5) Say 'Give me a hint'. I'll turn the skill all the way up and find your best possible move!6)  Ask ""How many hints do I have left?"" to find out how many are available in your game.7) Say ""Tutorial"" to begin an in-game tutorial and get a little bit of help!LEADERBOARDS?Of course!1) Say ""Change my name to {username}"" to change your name for world display and bragging rights!When playing competitive mode, you get ten minutes to make your move. If you run out of time, you forfeit the game and your opponent gets the points. You also get points winning a computer game with extra points depending on the difficulty.Questions, comments, suggestions?
